    <ul class="quotes">
      <li>Unfortunately, no one can be told what The Matrix is. You'll have to see it for yourself.</li>
      <li>Throughout human history, we have been dependent on machines to survive. Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony.</li>
      <li>If real is what you can feel, smell, taste and see, then 'real' is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain.</li>
      <li>He is the one!</li>
